R-Type              R-Type communication protocol          November 2020 

    1. Introduction

        This Request for Comments (RFC) provides information about the
        communication protocol of the R-Type project.
        Through this RFC I will make sure that you, as a reader, 
        understand how to communicate with the Server properly.

________________________________________________________________________

    2. Communications's basis

        The server and client communicate through the usage of packet.
        Packets implementation doesn't matter as long 
        as their data is ordered.
        The first part of a packet MUST start by the code assosiated
        with the action you want to perform. Thoses codes will be
        listed in the sections below.
        Here's a quick basic of how it will look like.

        Client to Server communication
        1XX/Data
        Example : 105/player_nb:pos_x:pos_y -> Player position update

        Server to Client communication
        2XX/Data
        Example : 205/player_nb:pos_x:pos_y -> Player position update
        800/Error_message

    3. Client to Server - Room management

        - To create a room, a packet starting with the code 100 MUST be 
        sent.
        - To retrieve informations on the different rooms, a packet 
        starting with the code 101 MUST be sent.
        - To join a room, a packet starting with the code 102 MUST be 
        sent followed by the number of the room.
        - To ask the server what is your position in the lobby, a packet
        starting with the code 103 MUST be sent.
        - To leave a room, a packet starting with the code 104 MUST be
        sent.

    4. Client to Server - Player management

        To manage a player there are several codes you MUST send to the
        server so the other players can update their game.

        - When your player moves you MUST send the following code
        105/player_nb:pos_x:pos_y
        Example : 105/1:130:40

        - When your player shoots you MUST send the following code
        106/player_nb
        Example : 106/1

        - When your player dies you MUST send the following code
        107/player_nb
        Example : 107/1

        - When your player takes damages you MUST send the following 
        code 108/player_nb:damages
        Example : 108/1:5

    5. Server to Client - Player management

        When receiving messages from the clients, the server WILL
        respond with the following codes. And the data associated
        with them WILL be the one sent by the client who contacted
        the server

        - 205/Z:X:Y = The Player Z is now at position X/Y
        - 206/Z = The player Z shot a bullet
        - 207/Z = The player Z is dead
        - 208/Z:X = The Player Z took X damages

    6. Server to Client - Enemy management

        The server WILL send the following messages to notify the
        players inside the same room ofwhat happends to the enemies.

        - 209/X = The enemy number X is dead
        - 210/X:Y = The enemy number X took Y damages
